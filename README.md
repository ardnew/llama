# walk

Walk is based on [antonmedv/walk](https://github.com/antonmedv/walk) with modifications to enable reuse as a component in other [BubbleTea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) applications, along with some other bugfixes and enhancements. 

To use the `walk` component, install the module using:

```
go get github.com/ardnew/walk/v2
```

The original `walk` command has been refactored into the [cmd/lk](cmd/lk) submodule ([README.md](cmd/lk/README.md)) and can be installed using:

```
go get github.com/ardnew/walk/v2/cmd/lk
```
